# Box

## Box

_This class creates a basic, responsive container with consistent styling for content blocks. It's ideal for structuring content sections and aligning elements within them._



Use this component by adding `.box` class in element....&#x20;

The `center-box` class aligns content within that container.





## Examples

```html
<div class="box"> 
   <div class="center-box"> 
     <h2>This heading is centered both horizontally and vertically</h2>
  </div>
    <p>This paragraph is also centered within the box.</p>
</div>
```
