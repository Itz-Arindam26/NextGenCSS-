## **You may ask  'Why NextGenCSS ' ?**&#x20;

Do you remember the time when people uses COBOL , C++ , C , FORTRAN as their programming language ? You might answer "Yes! very looong time ago ..." . But why don't they use that today ??

Because they are replaced by new languages .

There was a time when people prefer plain HTML , JS ,CSS ,But now people are moving to js frameworks like Svelte , Vue , Angular , React ...

Do you know why ??

People are moving towards latest techs , Every month some new framework or library is taking place of existing one&#x20;

Devs adopt new techs because of :

1. **Improved Performance:** New frameworks and libraries may offer better performance, allowing developers to create faster and more responsive applications.
2. **Enhanced Features:** New technologies often come with additional features and capabilities, enabling developers to build more sophisticated and feature-rich applications.
3. **Ease of Use:** Frameworks that are easier to use or have more intuitive APIs can gain popularity quickly, as they reduce the learning curve for developers.
4. **Community Support:** The size and activity of the developer community around a technology can greatly influence its adoption. A vibrant community can provide valuable resources, support, and a wealth of third-party libraries.
5. **Security and Stability:** Technologies that are perceived as more secure or stable may replace older ones.
