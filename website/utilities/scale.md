# Scale



Scale a element in **`.scale-{..}`** class

There are 2 ways in which you can scale a block

&#x20;\- By increasing the size , scaling factor > =1&#x20;

&#x20;\- By decreasing the size , scaling factor < 1





**For scaling factor >= 1**

* `.scale-1`                                                    scaling factor = 1
* `.scale-2`                                                   scaling factor = 2
* `.scale-3`                                                    scaling factor = 3
* `.scale-4`                                                    scaling factor = 4



**For scaling factor < 1**

* `.scale-01`                                                    scaling factor = 0.1
* `.scale-02`                                                    scaling factor = 0.2
* `.scale-03`                                                    scaling factor = 0.3
* `.scale-04`                                                    scaling factor = 0.4
