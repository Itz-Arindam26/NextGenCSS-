<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/img1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Me : *a new framework came yesterday</p></figcaption></figure>

This new framework helps you to design websites faster by including&#x20;

* Custom tag for some components&#x20;
* Class names of your own choice&#x20;
* In-built Optimizations like lazy-load and more....
* Pre-built components to use in form of HTML tags
* Default styling of some tags

Not only this , in future we are looking to add more features and make it production ready ...



## Use case to use it in real life

Stop learning names of utility , you can change the class names in just 1 minutes and define your own names for your team of your choice .

You can name it literally anything you want

for example if you hate `.pd` for padding

Then you can change it for you whatever you like

`.my-pd` , `.padd` , `.space`
